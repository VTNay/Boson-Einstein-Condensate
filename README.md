# Boson-Einstein-Condensate
This project is to try to solve the GrossPitaevskii equation numerically. To do that, we will use the Crank-Nicholson algorithm.
We will try to solve GPE in 1D and 2D. We will create some tests to verify our code.
Furthermore, we illustrate how the ground state solution is initially localized using imaginary time propagation and how dark and vortex soliton solutions are generated in 2D.
